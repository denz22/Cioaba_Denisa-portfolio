          I’m a structured, curious and detail-oriented professional with experience in configuration
          management, project planning and data organization. I enjoy work that combines accurate

          refine the process.

          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>
              I currently work with Java and Python at beginner level, and I’m building my knowledge step by step.
              I also use HTML and CSS at a beginner–intermediate level, mostly for small personal projects and this portfolio.

          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>
              I’m a curious, detail-oriented person who learns quickly when something new catches my interest.
              I’m not afraid to make mistakes as long as I can understand them and fix them. I like to build structure,
              ask questions and understand “why”, not just “what”.

          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>
              I see AI as a powerful tool that can support people in their work – not replace them. Used in the right
              context, it saves time and helps with ideas. Used without responsibility, it can create problems or remove
              the human perspective. I like AI as an assistant for humans, not as a full replacement.

          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>
              I enjoy learning new things and being challenged with new situations that force me to think differently.
              Routine work is okay sometimes, but I prefer tasks where I have to analyze, connect dots and solve problems.

          <button class="qa-question">What are your main strengths?</button>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>
              Curiosity and determination. I believe you can learn almost anything if you’re genuinely curious and willing
              to put in the effort. When I don’t understand something, I tend to stay with it until it finally makes sense.

          <button class="qa-question">How do you handle pressure?</button>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>
              I handle pressure well enough to deliver my work on time. A bit of pressure can even help me focus and push
              myself to 110%. I prioritize, break tasks into steps and try not to panic.

          <button class="qa-question">How do you work in a team?</button>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>
              I like to communicate and support the people I work with. I believe work becomes much more efficient when
              people share information instead of working in silence. I appreciate teams where we can ask questions,
              help each other and be honest about blockers.

        <div class="qa-item">
          <button class="qa-question">What makes you different from other candidates?</button>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>
              My curiosity and the way I see things. Having dyslexia and ADHD means I often notice patterns or connections
              that others might not see immediately. When something doesn’t make sense to me, I dig into it until I can
              really explain it, not just repeat it.

        <div class="qa-item">
          <button class="qa-question">How do you receive feedback and criticism?</button>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>
              I’m open to feedback as long as it’s given with respect and with the intention to help. I don’t expect to
              be perfect, and I know that mistakes or confusion can happen. Good feedback is an opportunity to adjust
              and grow, not a personal attack.

          <button class="qa-question">How do you deal with learning new tools or technologies?</button>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>
              I usually learn fast enough to get the job done. If I need to use a new tool, I stay with it until I feel
              confident enough to work independently. I ask questions, read documentation and test things myself.

        <div class="qa-item">
          <button class="qa-question">What can demotivate you at work?</button>
          <div class="qa-answer">
            <p>
              A very toxic environment: when people split into “small groups”, stop communicating and management acts
              with superiority instead of support. I work much better in teams where people respect each other and share
              information openly.

            <p>
              I’m flexible, but I’d prefer a hybrid setup, with some days in the office and some days remote, plus a
              schedule that allows a bit of flexibility when needed.
